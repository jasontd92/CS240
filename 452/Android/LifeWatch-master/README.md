Storing user motion patterns

This data can be used to better service the overall UX with customized app suggestions, advertising, and even accident detection. The motion data to be stored is collected through many of the mobile device's internal sensors, such as the acclerometer, barometer, ghyroscope, and GPS (if enabled by user, but not required)
